# Swing-GameOfLife
A Java Swing implementation of Conway's Game of Life and life's rule families

The Game of Life
Also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players,
by creating patterns with particular properties. [1]


#Life rules notation

Life rules are defined in the "S/B" form, where:
S - defines counts of alive neighbors necessary for a cell to survive,
B - defines counts of alive neighbors necessary for a cell to be born.

Note that the count of colors (states) has no influence on next generations, because Life is a one-bit family of rules.[2]
